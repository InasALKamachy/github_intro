To pull the file that is added in remote repository to local repository, we use PULL command git pull
To add a branch in master branch git branch branchname

Switch the branch git checkout branchname

Adding a file in branch echo "#content">> filename.txt

Then add the file and push the file. To create the branch remotely we have to use git push --set-upstream origin branchname
Switch the branch again to the master using git checkout master

Merge command to merge the branches git merge mybranch

As the merge command is used the new create branch will be merged to the master branch and the file will be inserted to it. Previously, we have 2 file in the master, now there are 3 files. Make sure to push the files using git push
